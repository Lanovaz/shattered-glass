_Information Sharding for Universal Information Storage utilizing Universal Information Identifiers_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
========

ShatteredGlass uses *Information Sharding* to shatter information bit
strings into Shards for persistence in a *Universal Information Storage
Container*. No central authority is required to manage namespaces,
information owners, and information sharing. *Information Sharding* has
the following properties:

1)  *Universal Information Identifiers* provide unique information
    identity without the need for a central authority.

2)  Information is shattered (sharded) into one or more *Shards*.
    Authenticated encryption ensures shard privacy and integrity.

3)  *Information Dispersal Algorithms* (Erasure Coding [1]) are
    optionally used for data redundancy [2] that provides resistance to
    shard loss and enables *Information* *Horse Racing* and *Information
    Quorums*.

4)  Cryptographic primitives are based on sponge functions, specifically
    the Keccak [3] family of sponge functions used for permutation-based
    hashing, message authentication, authenticated encryption, and
    hash-based signatures [4].

5)  *Shard Servers* are unaware of shard contents, are unaware of shard
    interrelationships, and are unaware of shard ownership. No knowledge
    is obtained by analyzing the Shards stored on shard servers. Privacy
    and anonymity is maintained.

6)  Information Sharding, when used in conjunction with anonymity
    networks such as the Tor network[^5], is resistant to file-size
    analysis and traffic analysis.

Information Sharding is built using ideas from cryptography, erasure
coding, and distributed computing. I believe five aspects of
Information Sharding are unique to this specification:

1.  The definition of “*Information Sharding*”.

2.  The definition of a *Universal Information Identifier* (UII).

3.  Using cryptographic algorithms to derive—rather than
    store—shard UIIs. The information owner or group computes the
    identity of any information shard at runtime. It is computationally
    intractable for an attacker to deduce shard relationships.

4.  Shard Server simplicity; servers simply need to store shards by UII
    and return shards by UII. All other processing is performed on
    the client.

5.  The ability to optionally transform shards, for example, into image
    files such as Portable Network Graphic (PNG) files, for storage on
    cloud-based image storage services such as Google Photos or
    Facebook[^6].

I have created a version of Information Sharding written entirely in
Javascript[^7]. This implies that Information Sharding can run on any
client computer that supports web technology. The system can store
shards either on a standard local file system, on a Hadoop[^8] storage
cluster, in an email system such as Gmail, or on a photo sharing cloud
service by masquerading the shards as well-formed PNG files (Google
Photos).

Source Code
===========

The current source code is sharded in the Shards directory and a
PNG image file version sharded in the ShardsPNG directory.

The source code is encrypted until the ShatteredGlass specification
is completed.
